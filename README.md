Open Source Facebook Bot creator
-------
Alot of companies seem to be making big profits off facebook bot creation programs,
however we created an in house bot to run a simple booking system, this soon started
to expand to the point we wanted to make our own web based creation system.
We decided to open source it and *WOULD LOVE* Help where possible!!!!
-------

At the moment the project is split between two repositories and I am currently in the process
of combining them to commit here. This is very much a work in progress and required *ALOT* of front
end work to get it operational.

I will state again *WE WOULD REALLY LOVE YOUR HELP!!!*
if there is anything you can contribute to the project please issue a pull request.

The backend is written in python2.7 and the front end mostly TypeScript and SASS, the server to host the
*OLD* crm is also written in python tornadoweb (sorry django fans, it just gave me more control)
and the backend also requires a local mongodb server.

I want to keep the project as modular as possible too (see the old CRM) so that new features
can just be plugged in and basically create the Facebook Bot Creator version of Wordpress (except
ALOT more secure)

If anyone is willing to help a bit more then I can give them direct access to my DEV environment.

-- Other Goals --
- Intergrate with api.ai or similar
- Create a fully functioning CRM system and scrape incoming messages for emails, phone numbers etc
- Booking systems

Thanks :)
